Computers are everywhere. In your pocket, in your TV and even in your fridge. All these devices come with some sort of operating system, enabling developers to write apps for them. One would be inclined to think that this surely is the “Era of computers” or even the “Era of apps”, but I beg to differ. Let me explain.

The only reason we came up with computers is to deal with information. If we found something better, computers would go out of fashion instantly. It’s all about transforming data. So, rather than in the “Computer era”, we’re still in the “Information era”.

To some degree, I’d argue we’ve always been in it. At least every time a civilisation has realised that gathering information for further analysis is valuable. It really doesn’t matter what tools they used to perform that analysis. You probably never heard about the “Abacus era”, so why should we talk about the “Computer era”? Eras are not defined by tools, but by the resources those tools exploit.

Apps are the tools of our era. We’ve focused on making them easy to write and usable. That’s great, but it’s not enough. We often loose sight of what’s truly important. Yes, it’s nice to have objects so we can model problems easily, or interpreted languages that are programmer friendly and forgiving, but the truth is that these paradigms distract us from our real goal as programmers.

We’re tool builders –not strictly problem modellers– and we’re in the information business. We should always understand the information we handle and how to transform it in a useful way. Everything else is secondary.
