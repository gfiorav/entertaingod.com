I might be wrong, though.</h5>
<p>My wife and I live in New York. We planned on celebrating our wedding in Spain (our homeland) on the 20th of March 2020. We flew out there with bags packed for a two-week-long trip and a honeymoon. Coronavirus had other plans for us. We ended up canceling the wedding and were stranded in a locked-down Spain for five months until we could finally make it back.</p>
<p>During this time, I had a lot of time to watch the news in Spain. I started noticing a trend. Out of 10 new stories in the 24 hours live Spanish TV, four were about how badly the US dealt with the pandemic and racial tensions. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand there&rsquo;s plenty to complain about when looking at the USA&rsquo;s pandemic reaction and racial violence, but something felt off. Spain is one of the worst-hit countries in the world when looking at per-population numbers. The public cried for the media not to show bodies piling up in Spanish hospitals. Yet, somehow, everyone felt comfortable commenting on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/10/831875297/burials-on-new-york-island-are-not-new-but-are-increasing-during-pandemic">images from New York&rsquo;s unclaimed body mass-burial in Ellie&rsquo;s Island</a>. What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long suspected there&rsquo;s an ill-fascination with the US among Spaniards (and to some extent Europeans). It&rsquo;s like deep-down, we Europeans feel self-conscious about our democracies and liberties and somehow need to declare America&rsquo;s outdated or primitive to feel better about ours.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care about this. And from what I gather, the USA doesn&rsquo;t care about it either. But, there&rsquo;s one area of this whole toxic culture that I think we should address: mocking US diversity policies.</p>
<p><img src="/img/power_minorities.jpeg" alt="Martin Luther King Jr, Barack Obama, and Kamala Harris in a collage" title="Examples of minorities in power positions in the United States"></p>
<p>There is no shortage of Spaniards (and generally Europeans) that often laugh at the USA&rsquo;s diversity policies. The mocking is that race surveys and political correctness are just for-show measures to make white Americans feel good about themselves. I don&rsquo;t believe this is the case, but I&rsquo;m not here to argue about that. I&rsquo;m just hoping to make some fellow Europeans reading this reconsider their position on the matter.</p>
<p>Someone sent me an article from a prominent Spanish news outlet the other day, which finally prompted me to write this piece. A <em>white man</em> from Spain complains <em>he</em> felt discriminated against working in the USA when he had to fill in his race profile in a standard survey. Now, honestly, I don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get the irony out of the way. A white man from a country with less than a 2.5% black population unilaterally declares that a country with a 15% black population is handling diversity all wrong because he misunderstood the purpose of diversity surveys. And that&rsquo;s news worthy for a major news outlet. I&rsquo;d forgive you for thinking Spaniards (and generally Europeans) are self-centered and don&rsquo;t know anything about the rest of the world, which, ironically, is precisely what Spaniards and Europeans think about the USA!</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s going on? Arrogance, in short. Yet another trait that Spaniards and Europeans love to pin on Americans. You see, you can&rsquo;t assume you know a problem when you haven&rsquo;t experienced it first-hand (or even second-hand in the case of Spain). Growing up in Madrid (Spain&rsquo;s capital city), I interacted with a total of three black kids, and I never saw a black man or woman in a position of power. Some Spaniards reading this might be rushing to Wikipedia to find some exception to the rule, but that proves nothing. Exceptions don&rsquo;t make a rule. If we compare New York&rsquo;s diversity during the same period (which isn&rsquo;t even the US&rsquo;s capital), we see a much different story. Less than 45% of New York City is white.</p>
<p>For someone to say they&rsquo;re not racist and to mock other countries trying to combat racism is the most arrogant and ignorant position you could ever adopt. Especially for someone who&rsquo;s grown up and worked in an all-white environment in an almost all-white country such as Spain. As much as it shames me to admit this, in Spain, we&rsquo;re in the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m racist, problem solved!&rdquo; phase of racism. We know so little about the rest of the world, and we think so much about our own culture that we don&rsquo;t understand our ignorance. What makes me worry even more is that self-appointed progressives seem to be the prime holders of this United States grudge.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been criticizing Spain hard for a few paragraphs now, let me try to set the record straight. Spaniards are some of the most understanding and nonjudgemental people I&rsquo;ve met (account for my obvious bias). For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay-friendly">we consistently rank in the top 10 most LGTB friendly countries globally</a>. In my experience, 99% of Spaniard&rsquo;s questions about your origin are good-spirited, and just a segway so you can talk about your countries traditions and customs (something we value very highly). I&rsquo;ve also witnessed this country strike down old prejudices and come together to accept change. In other words, I take absolutely no issue with being a Spaniard. Like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1868-i-love-america-more-than-any-other-country-in-the">James Baldwin put it</a>: <em>&ldquo;I love America more than any other country in the world and, precisely for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.&quot;</em> It&rsquo;s something similar for me regarding Spain and this piece.</p>
<p><img src="/img/james_baldwin.jpeg" alt="A picture of American novelist James Baldwin" title="American novelist James Baldwin."></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to shame my fellow Europeans or try to come across as a racism expert. I could never be that. I&rsquo;ve never been on the receiving end of the pain and oppression racism creates. I&rsquo;m just trying to tell my people from Spain: let&rsquo;s understand we&rsquo;re ignorant about racism and re-evaluate our assumptions as our country becomes racially diverse. Until then, let us quiet down so we might give voice to those we silence by our mocking and loud uninformed opinions on racial issues. After this, I&rsquo;ll be the first one to follow my advice.</p>
